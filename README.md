I'm a programmer focused on the JavaScript Stack, where along with typescript I go deeper and deeper into the world of Node.js

I aim to make the technologies used by large companies accessible to the general public, mainly to take them to small cities through simple and complex projects with high scalability, in order to maintain market valuation and transform the world through technology.

ðŸŒ± Sharbe and I currently work 100% with JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS and Next.js
